Members of this family include: At5g60810 (RGF1), At1g13620 (RGF2), At2g04025 (RGF3), At3g30350 (RGF4), At5g51451 (RGF5), At4g16515 (RGF6), At3g02240 (RGF7), At2g03830 (RGF8) and At5g64770 (RGF9). | chr2:1171226-1172147 FORWARD LENGTH=123

Members of this family include: At5g60810 (RGF1), At1g13620 (RGF2), At2g04025 (RGF3), At3g30350 (RGF4), At5g51451 (RGF5), At4g16515 (RGF6), At3g02240 (RGF7), At2g03830 (RGF8) and At5g64770 (RGF9). | chr4:9305386-9305646 REVERSE LENGTH=86
